## üéØ System Overview

The registration system is designed to ensure only users who have actually paid
get confirmed spots, while providing flexibility for admin management and
handling edge cases gracefully. The system operates on a **webpage-centric
experience** with minimal email communication.

### Key Principles

- **Payment-First**: All registrations require payment verification
- **Capacity-Aware**: Proper counting based on payment status
- **Admin-Controlled**: Final verification authority rests with admins
- **User-Friendly**: Clear status visibility and simple payment claiming
- **Flexible**: Supports multiple payment methods and edge cases

---

## üîÑ Core Use Cases

### 1. User Self-Registration

**Actor**: Regular user  
**Preconditions**: User has verified account, event is open for registration  
**Flow**:

1. User clicks "Register" on event page
2. System checks event capacity and registration status
3. If capacity available ‚Üí Show payment details + QR code on webpage
4. If full ‚Üí Add to waiting list
5. **NO EMAIL SENT** at this stage

**Business Rules**:

- Only users with verified accounts can register
- Registration requires payment (no free events)
- Payment details displayed directly on webpage
- User must claim payment before taking spot in register list

**Postconditions**: User has `PENDING_VERIFICATION` status, payment details
visible

### 2. Friend Registration

**Actor**: User registering for someone else  
**Preconditions**: User has verified account, event allows friend registration  
**Flow**:

1. User fills friend's name (required) + optional contact info
2. Same payment flow as self-registration
3. Payment details displayed on webpage (no email)
4. Friend appears in registration list with special indicator

**Business Rules**:

- Only name is required for friend
- Friend doesn't need account
- Registering user is responsible for payment
- Friend gets same event access as regular registrant
- Limit number of friends per user (e.g., max 3)

**Postconditions**: Friend registration created with `PENDING_VERIFICATION`
status

### 3. Payment Claiming Process

**Actor**: User who registered  
**Preconditions**: User has `PENDING_VERIFICATION` status  
**Flow**:

1. User sees payment details and QR code on webpage
2. User clicks "I've sent the payment" button on same page
3. Status changes to `PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION`
4. **CONFIRMATION EMAIL SENT** to user
5. Registration now takes spot in capacity count

**Business Rules**:

- Only users with `PENDING_VERIFICATION` status can claim
- Claiming moves user from pending to registered list
- If capacity exceeded during claiming, user moved to waiting list
- **ONLY EMAIL SENT** when user claims payment
- Users can claim payment multiple times (no penalty)

**Postconditions**: User has `PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION` status, spot
reserved

### 4. Admin Payment Verification

**Actor**: Event admin/manager  
**Preconditions**: Admin has verification permissions  
**Flow**:

1. Admin sees list of pending payments
2. Admin checks bank account for payments
3. Admin approves/rejects each payment
4. System sends notifications to users

**Business Rules**:

- Only admins can verify payments
- Rejected payments move user back to pending or waiting list
- Approved payments confirm registration spot
- Cash payments can be marked as `VERIFIED_CASH`
- Bulk operations supported for efficiency

**Postconditions**: Payment status updated, user notified, capacity adjusted

### 5. Waiting List Management

**Actor**: System + Users  
**Preconditions**: Event at capacity, waiting list enabled  
**Flow**:

1. When registration is cancelled ‚Üí Promote next in waiting list
2. When payment is rejected ‚Üí Move to waiting list
3. When spot opens ‚Üí Show payment details on webpage (no email)
4. Promoted users get payment instructions on webpage

**Business Rules**:

- Waiting list is first-come-first-served
- Promoted users see payment details on webpage
- No time limits for payment claiming
- Waiting list doesn't count toward capacity
- Position numbers updated automatically

**Postconditions**: Users moved between lists, capacity maintained

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Requirements

### Current Schema Structure

The system has a comprehensive schema that supports the registration flow. Here
are the key components:

#### Registration Status Enums

```typescript
enum RegistrationStatus {
  PENDING // Awaiting approval/payment
  CONFIRMED // Confirmed attendance
  CANCELLED // User cancelled
  REJECTED // Admin rejected
  ATTENDED // Actually attended event
  NO_SHOW // Didn't show up
}

enum RegistrationPaymentStatus {
  PENDING_VERIFICATION                    // Doesn't take spot
  PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION     // Takes spot
  PAYMENT_VERIFIED                       // Takes spot (confirmed)
  VERIFIED_CASH                          // Takes spot (cash payment)
  REJECTED                               // Back to pending or waiting list
  WAITING_LIST_PROMOTED                  // New status for promoted users
}

enum RegistrationType {
  INDIVIDUAL // Single person registration
  GROUP // Group registration with friends

### Schema Mapping to Business Requirements

#### Payment Status Mapping

| Business Status                    | Schema Status                      | Model                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| PENDING_VERIFICATION               | PENDING_VERIFICATION               | Registration.paymentStatus |
| PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION | PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION | Registration.paymentStatus |
| PAYMENT_VERIFIED                   | PAYMENT_VERIFIED                   | Registration.paymentStatus |
| VERIFIED_CASH                      | VERIFIED_CASH                      | Registration.paymentStatus |
| REJECTED                           | REJECTED                           | Registration.paymentStatus |
| WAITING_LIST_PROMOTED              | WAITING_LIST_PROMOTED              | Registration.paymentStatus |

#### Capacity Management

The schema supports capacity management through:

- `PendingPayment.totalParticipants` - Tracks group size
- `Registration.groupSize` - Tracks confirmed group size
- `WaitingList.groupSize` - Tracks waiting list group size
- `promotedFromWaitingList` flag - Tracks promotion history
- `Registration.paymentStatus` - Determines if registration takes a spot

#### Friend Registration Support

The schema fully supports friend registration through:

- `friendsData` JSON field in both PendingPayment and Registration
- `RegistrationType.GROUP` for group registrations
- `isGroupLeader` and `groupLeaderId` for group relationships
- `friendPosition` for ordering within groups
- `friendInfo` and `registeredBy` fields for friend tracking

#### Payment Integration

The schema supports payment tracking through:

- `PendingPayment` model for payment lifecycle
- `Payment` model for verified payments
- `BankAccount` model for payment methods
- QR code generation support
- Variable symbol tracking for bank transfers
- Payment claiming and verification tracking

### Schema Advantages

1. **Comprehensive Payment Flow**: Supports the complete payment lifecycle from
   pending to verified
2. **Group Registration**: Full support for friend registration with group
   management
3. **Guest Registration**: Supports non-authenticated user registrations
4. **Waiting List Management**: Complete waiting list with promotion tracking
5. **Audit Trail**: Registration history and audit logs for all changes
6. **Flexible Payment Methods**: Supports QR codes, bank transfers, and cash
   payments
7. **Capacity Tracking**: Proper capacity management with group size support
8. **Admin Override**: Supports admin-created registrations and capacity
   overrides
9. **Payment Status Tracking**: Granular payment status management
10. **Friend Registration**: Complete friend registration support with tracking

The current schema now fully supports all the business requirements outlined in
the analysis. The implementation should focus on the business logic layer to
utilize the existing schema effectively.

### Capacity Management Logic

```typescript
function getEffectiveRegistrationCount(eventId: string) {
  return registrations.filter((r) =>
    [
      "PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION",
      "PAYMENT_VERIFIED",
      "VERIFIED_CASH",
    ].includes(r.paymentStatus)
  ).length;
}

function hasCapacity(eventId: string) {
  const currentCount = getEffectiveRegistrationCount(eventId);
  const event = getEvent(eventId);
  return currentCount < event.capacity;
}
```

## üìä Status Management

### Status Transition Rules

| Current Status                     | Action              | New Status                         | Takes Spot | Email Sent      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| PENDING_VERIFICATION               | User claims payment | PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Confirmation |
| PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION | Admin approves      | PAYMENT_VERIFIED                   | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Verification |
| PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION | Admin rejects       | REJECTED                           | ‚ùå No      | ‚úÖ Rejection    |
| PENDING_VERIFICATION               | Admin cash payment  | VERIFIED_CASH                      | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Verification |
| WAITING_LIST                       | Promoted from list  | WAITING_LIST_PROMOTED              | ‚ùå No      | ‚ùå None         |

### Status Descriptions

- **PENDING_VERIFICATION**: User registered, payment details shown, no spot
  taken
- **PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION**: User claimed payment, spot reserved,
  awaiting admin
- **PAYMENT_VERIFIED**: Payment confirmed by admin, spot confirmed
- **VERIFIED_CASH**: Cash payment verified by admin, spot confirmed
- **REJECTED**: Payment rejected, moved to waiting list or back to pending
- **WAITING_LIST_PROMOTED**: Promoted from waiting list, payment details shown

---

## üéØ Capacity Management

### Registration List vs Waiting List

**Registration List** (Takes spots):

- `PAYMENT_SENT_AWAITING_VERIFICATION`
- `PAYMENT_VERIFIED`
- `VERIFIED_CASH`

**Waiting List** (No spots taken):

- `WAITING_LIST`
- `PENDING_VERIFICATION` (when capacity full)

### Capacity Calculation

```typescript
function calculateCapacity(eventId: string) {
  const event = getEvent(eventId);
  const registeredCount = getEffectiveRegistrationCount(eventId);
  const availableSpots = event.capacity - registeredCount;

  return {
    total: event.capacity,
    registered: registeredCount,
    available: Math.max(0, availableSpots),
    waitingListCount: getWaitingListCount(eventId),
  };
}
```

### Waiting List Promotion Logic

```typescript
async function promoteFromWaitingList(eventId: string) {
  const nextInLine = await getNextWaitingListEntry(eventId);

  if (nextInLine && hasCapacity(eventId)) {
    // Move to registration with WAITING_LIST_PROMOTED status
    await createRegistrationFromWaitingList(nextInLine);

    // Send payment details to webpage (no email)
    await updateUserInterface(nextInLine.userId);

    // Update waiting list positions
    await updateWaitingListPositions(eventId);
  }
}
```
