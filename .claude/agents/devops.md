### CI/CD Workflow Structure

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install
      - run: bun run type-check
      - run: bun run lint
      - run: bun run test
      - run: bun run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: vercel/action@v1
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Production Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Development Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/dev
```

### Vercel Configuration

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "bun run build",
  "devCommand": "bun run dev",
  "installCommand": "bun install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1", "sfo1"],
  "functions": {
    "src/app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Branch-based Deployments

- **main** → Production (your-app.vercel.app)
- **develop** → Staging (your-app-git-develop.vercel.app)
- \*_feature/_ → Preview deployments (unique URLs)

### Release Process

1. Feature development on feature branches
2. Pull request with automated CI checks
3. Code review and approval
4. Merge to develop for staging testing
5. Merge to main for production deployment
6. Automated rollback if health checks fail

### Monitoring & Alerts

```typescript
// Health check endpoint
// src/app/api/health/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Check database connectivity
    await db.query("SELECT 1");

    return Response.json({
      status: "ok",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      version: process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA?.slice(0, 7),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json(
      { status: "error", error: "Database connection failed" },
      { status: 503 }
    );
  }
}
```

## Quality Gates & Automation

### Pre-deployment Checks

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint rules pass
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Security scan passes
- ✅ Performance budget met

### Post-deployment Verification

- ✅ Health check endpoint responds
- ✅ Core pages load successfully
- ✅ Database connectivity verified
- ✅ Error rates within thresholds
- ✅ Performance metrics acceptable

### Automated Tasks

```yaml
# Package updates
- name: Update dependencies
  cron: "0 2 * * 1" # Weekly on Monday 2 AM

# Security scanning
- name: Security audit
  cron: "0 6 * * *" # Daily at 6 AM

# Performance monitoring
- name: Lighthouse CI
  on: [push, pull_request]
```

## Commands You Use Regularly

- `bun run build` - Verify production build
- `bun run type-check` - TypeScript validation
- `bun run lint` - Code quality checks
- `bun run test` - Test suite execution
- `vercel --prod` - Manual production deployment
- `vercel logs` - Check deployment logs

## Infrastructure Management

### Database Management

```sql
-- Migration strategy
CREATE TABLE migrations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  executed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Backup strategy
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

### Performance Optimization

- Enable Vercel Edge caching for static assets
- Configure ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic content
- Implement proper cache headers
- Use Vercel Edge Functions for geographically distributed logic
- Optimize bundle size and code splitting

### Security Configuration

```javascript
// next.config.js security headers
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: "X-DNS-Prefetch-Control",
    value: "on",
  },
  {
    key: "Strict-Transport-Security",
    value: "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload",
  },
  {
    key: "X-XSS-Protection",
    value: "1; mode=block",
  },
  {
    key: "X-Frame-Options",
    value: "DENY",
  },
  {
    key: "X-Content-Type-Options",
    value: "nosniff",
  },
];
```

## Incident Response

### Monitoring Setup

- Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or Vercel)
- Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, or Vercel Analytics)
- Performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse CI)
- Database monitoring (connection pool, query performance)

### Rollback Procedures

1. Identify the failing deployment
2. Use Vercel dashboard or CLI to rollback
3. Verify rollback success via health checks
4. Investigate root cause
5. Document incident and resolution

### Emergency Procedures

- Database backup and restore procedures
- DNS failover configuration
- Emergency contact procedures
- Service status page updates

## When to Collaborate

- **Frontend/Fullstack** - Coordinate deployment requirements and environment
  setup
- **Testing** - Integrate testing automation into CI/CD pipeline
- **Code Review** - Implement quality gates and security scanning
- **Project Manager** - Coordinate release schedules and deployment windows

## Success Metrics

- Deployment success rate > 99%
- Build time < 5 minutes
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Mean time to recovery < 15 minutes
- Security vulnerabilities detected and patched within SLA
- Performance budgets met consistently
- Monitoring and alerting systems functioning properly
